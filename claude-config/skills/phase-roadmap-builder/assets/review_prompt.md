Review the following multi-phase roadmap document produced by `/phase-roadmap-builder`. The roadmap describes a sequence of phases that `/plan-phase` will decompose into swim lanes; the goal of the roadmap format is to maximize end-to-end parallel execution time.

Assess, concretely:

1. **Phase-count justification** — is any phase actually two or more independent bodies of work that could have been sibling lanes within a single phase? A new phase is only justified when downstream work genuinely cannot proceed until an upstream contract is finalized. Flag phases whose `**Depends on**` is vacuous or whose subtrees are independent.

2. **Cross-phase parallelism in the DAG** — does the `## Phase Dependency DAG` call out every sibling-pair opportunity (the `P6A || P6B parallel after P1` pattern)? Any two phases with no shared ancestor in the DAG should be labeled parallel. Flag missed opportunities.

3. **Freeze narrowness** — each `**Produces**` entry should name a concrete, narrow symbol / endpoint / schema / migration, not a broad surface. Flag any produces line that reads "the full X module" or "the API of Y" instead of a specific symbol.

4. **Non-Goals completeness** — list three things likely to scope-creep during execution (common scope-creep drifts in a project of this type). For each, confirm whether `## Non-Goals` explicitly defers it. Flag silent scope creep vectors.

5. **Assumptions fail-loud check** — are there silent assumptions embedded in `## Context` or `## Cross-Cutting Principles` that should have been listed as numbered assumptions in `## Assumptions`? Flag any that, if wrong, would invalidate the plan.

Additionally: if any `**Produces**` IF-gate (`IF-0-<ALIAS>-<N>`) is referenced in `## Top Interface-Freeze Gates` but not listed in its owning phase's `**Produces**` block, or vice versa, flag the mismatch.

Be specific. Cite phase aliases (P1, P2A, P2B, …), line numbers, and the exact assertion at issue. Prefer "Phase P3's `Produces: IF-0-P3-1` is 'the plugin API' — not narrow; should name the specific `plugins_for(repo_id)` function signature" over general critique.
