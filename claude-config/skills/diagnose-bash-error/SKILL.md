# Diagnose Bash Error

## The Rule

When a Bash command fails, NEVER re-run it without first reading the full stderr output and categorizing the error. The single most common waste pattern is retrying the same command hoping for a different result.

## Decision Tree

When a command fails, match stderr against these patterns:

### Exit Code 1 (General Error)
- stderr matches `TS\d+:` or `error TS` → TypeScript type error → Read the file at the reported line, fix the type issue
- stderr matches `Cannot find module` or `ModuleNotFoundError` → Missing dependency → Run `npm install` or `pip install`, or check the import path
- stderr matches `No such file or directory` or `ENOENT` → Wrong path → Verify the file exists with Glob before re-running
- stderr matches `Permission denied` → Insufficient permissions → Check file ownership with `ls -la`, fix permissions
- stderr matches `EADDRINUSE` → Port conflict → Find what's using the port: `lsof -i :<port>`

### Exit Code 2 (Shell Misuse)
- stderr contains a line number → Syntax error → Read the file at that line and fix the syntax
- stderr matches `unexpected token` → Shell syntax error → Check for unclosed quotes, missing semicolons

### Exit Code 126 (Not Executable)
- `Permission denied` on a script → Run `chmod +x <script>` or invoke with interpreter: `bash <script>`

### Exit Code 127 (Command Not Found)
- Run `which <command>` exactly once
- Check if you're in a virtual env that has the tool: `ls .venv/bin/<command>`
- If truly not installed, tell the user — don't try to install it yourself without asking

### Exit Code 128+N (Killed by Signal)
- 137 (SIGKILL) → Out of memory → Reduce scope of operation, tell user about memory limits
- 139 (SIGSEGV) → Segfault → This is a bug in the program, not fixable by retrying
- 130 (SIGINT) → User interrupted → Don't retry; the user wanted it stopped

### Exit Code 255 (SSH/Network)
- `Connection refused` → Service not running → Check if the target service is up
- `Host not found` or `Could not resolve hostname` → DNS issue → Verify the hostname/URL

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Same command, different flag**: Trying `command --flag1`, then `command --flag2`, then `command --flag3` without understanding why the first one failed. Diagnose first.
2. **Tool-location chain**: Running `which tool`, `whereis tool`, `find / -name tool`, `type tool` in sequence. Run `which tool` once. If not found, it's not installed.
3. **Tool-switching instead of diagnosing**: Switching from `grep` to `rg` to `ag` because the first one "didn't work." The tool isn't the problem — your pattern or path is.
4. **Retry with wait**: Adding `sleep 5 && command` doesn't fix deterministic errors. Only use waits for genuinely transient issues (network timeouts, server startup).

## When to Ask the User

Stop trying to fix it yourself when:
- A required tool isn't installed (don't install system packages without asking)
- The error is environment-specific (wrong Python version, missing system library)
- You've diagnosed the issue but the fix requires elevated permissions
- The error suggests corrupted state (broken lockfile, corrupted node_modules) — suggest the fix, let the user approve
