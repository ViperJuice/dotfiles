# resolve_branch_from_sha.sh — map a commit SHA to exactly one local branch.
#
# Usage:
#     resolve_branch_from_sha.sh <commit-sha>
#
# Behavior:
#   - Lists local branches containing the SHA via `git branch --contains`.
#   - Exit 0 with the branch name on stdout if exactly one local branch matches.
#   - Exit 1 with a message on stderr if zero or multiple branches match.
#
# Rationale (from the execute-phase SKILL):
#   "Never trust a branch name; resolve by commit SHA from the teammate's
#    reply envelope." This script enforces that rule mechanically so the
#    LLM doesn't have to re-derive branch-discovery logic per phase.
