#!/usr/bin/env bash
# sweep_stale_worktrees.sh — prune stale execute-phase worktrees from prior sessions.
#
# For each worktree (excluding the orchestrator's own checkout), checks whether its
# HEAD commit has been incorporated into the current merge target (HEAD).  Worktrees
# whose work is already on the target are removed; worktrees with unmerged work are
# kept and reported.
#
# Usage:
#   sweep_stale_worktrees.sh [--dry-run]
#
#   --dry-run   Print PRUNE/KEEP decisions without removing anything.
#
# Exit code: 0 on success (even if nothing was pruned); non-zero on git errors.
