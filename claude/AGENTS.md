## Screenshots

When the user references a screenshot or asks you to look at an image:

1. Check `~/screenshots/` for the most recent file:
   ```bash
   ls -t ~/screenshots/ | head -1
   ```

2. Use the Read tool to view the image file

The `~/screenshots` directory is symlinked to the Windows Screenshots folder.
